  # before code-fix
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
  ```
  ```
  # after code-fix
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length/2; i += 1) {
      int temp = arr[i];
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
      arr[arr.length - i - 1] = temp;
    }
  }
  ```
  This fixes the code as it creates a temp variable that holds the value of the index where the array is being reversed.
  This allows the for loop to reverse rather than the array being mirrored. Using the temp variable and changing it
  in the same iteration means that the loop only lasts half of the array length.

  The option -A means it will print the line with the pattern and n lines after it. This might be useful if someone
  wants context of lines of the files they grep

  ```
  The option -n means that the lines with the pattern are printed with their line numbers. This might be useful because
  you might want to know where the line of that file is located.
* __grep -i__ [Source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/)
  ```
  $ grep -i "cell" technical/biomed/*.txt

  $ grep -i "cell" technical/biomed/*.txt | wc
     21300  200834 2064064
  ```
  The option -i is case insensitive so it will grep lines with the pattern without checking cases. This is useful to people who are only
  focused on finding lines with that specific pattern and not interested in whether there are different cases or not. 
* __grep -v__ [Source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/)
  ```

  $ grep -v "cell" technical/plos/*.txt | wc

  ```
  The option -v prints all the lines that are not the pattern. This is useful for people who are trying to filter out the pattern
  rather than searching for the pattern.
