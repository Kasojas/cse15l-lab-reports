# Lab Report 4  
## Step 4: Log into ieng6  
[!Step4]()  
Keys Pressed: `ssh jam024@ieng <Enter>` which is the commands that logs me into ieng6  
## Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)  
[!Step5]()  
Keys Pressed: `git clone <ctrl-v> <Enter>`, git clone is the command that clones the repository,  
              the ssh URL was `git@github.com:Kasojas/lab7.git` which I copied from Github
              and pasted it into the terminal  
## Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail  
[!Step6]()  
Keys Pressed: `cd lab7 <Enter> <ctrl-v> <Enter> <ctrl-v> L <Tab> T <Tab> <Backspace> <Enter>`, I changed the working directory to lab7
              I copied `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` and pasted it into the terminal, 
              then copied and pasted `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore `
              and typed L and T with tab to autofill to ListExamplesTests. and backspace to delete the period so it becomes 
              `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests`  
## Step 7: Edit the code file to fix the failing test
